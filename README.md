## Bash Cheats

### Bash Keybinds

- `cntl+c` stops any command from running

Example:

- `cntl+r` to search for a command used in the past

Example:

- `cntl+a` to go  to the start of the line of the command
- `cntl+e` to go to the end of the line of the command
- `cntl+left arrow key` OR `cntl+right arrow key` to go left and right of letter bunches. Skipping all characters except spaces. basically to go from the end of a command to the start of the command in one keybind

Example:

- `cntl+L` to clear the terminal screen. Only inserts blank spaces for the screen itself. Scrolling up will show you the previous commands you have done  but it does clear the screen in a way

- `cntl+k` AND `cntl+u` to cut/delete everything to the end of the line. This is very useful when using `nano` (the terminal text editor).

Example:

### Bash Command Control

- `!!` to run the last command
- `sudo !!` to run the last command with superuser priveledges. This can save time if you forget to write sudo before a command as usually users use the left arrow key to go to the start of the command to type sudo. You can also use `cntl+a` to go to the start of the line to add sudo to it if you do not with to use this command

Example:
